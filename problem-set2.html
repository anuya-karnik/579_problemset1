            <h2> Background and Education </h2>
            <p>
                Hi, I am <strong>Anuya Karnik</strong>&#128515;! I am a first-year MSI student at UMSI, focusing on the UX-HCI Track.
                I have an undergraduate degree in Computer Science and a minor in Graphic Design and Mathematics.
                Studying computer science and graphic design together made me realize that the combination of 
                tech and design has a lot of capacity for innovation and creating new solutions. 
                It led me to apply at UMSI and deciding to pursue HCI as a career.

            <h2> Hobbies and Favorite Pastimes </h2>
            <p>
                Apart from coding and designing, I spend a considerable amount of time doing art projects and painting. 
                Oil paint is my favorite medium but I also love working with watercolor, gouache and graphite. 
                I also like to sing and am formally pursuing Indian Classical Music. Apart from this, I love to read, bake 
                and cook whenever I can.
